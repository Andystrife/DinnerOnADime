# DinnerOnADime
Small HTML/CSS Project created during my studies.<br>
The purpose of this project was to become familiar using HTML and CSS.<br>
There was no need to us JS or any other language for this project.<br>
The idea for the site was to give budget friendly meal options for the individual on the go.<br>
If the site was to continue it would transform into a budget food blog.<br>
