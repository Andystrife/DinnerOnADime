                Cook!". It's true as
                long as you take the time to learn the skills and techniques. I have included here a couple essential
                techniques that
                every home cook should learn. Knowing how to poach, stew, sear, and broil are techniques that will bring
                your cooking
                to the next level! Knife skills are also just as important as knowing how to cook your meal. We take
                focus on safety
                and precision. It will be a lot harder to to truss a chicken with only 9 fingers!
