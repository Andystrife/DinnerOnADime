                Throughout the years I have read quite the few cook books. Professional Cooking By Wayne Gisslen is the
                ultimate
                'learn to cook' book. It has tons of valuable information. It will show you butchery techniques, cooking
                methods,
                how and when to use certain ingredients, and recipes to reinforce what you've learned throughout the
                book. As for butchery,
                in Mastering the Art of Poultry, Meat, and Game, you learn many different ways to use every piece of
                your meat so that
                nothing goes to waste. Below are a couple included videos of some culinary basics. Learning the 5 Mothe
                Sauces and learning
                how to simply Roast a Chicken are tools that you will use time and time again.

                    One of the main meals that the home cook should know, is how to roast a whole chicken.
                    Buying a whole chicken in most cases is much less expensive than purchasing the pieces
                    individually. Learning this skill will fill your home and stomachs with delicious food!
